      <h3>so how can we help?</h3>
      <p>It's important for all of us to do our part in making mental health more equitable for everyone. A couple of key methods of providing support for our community would be <i>advocating for the cause, checking in with your loved ones, and volunteering or creating your own  to support the movement. </i></p>
      <h4>advocating</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Get involved with mental health petitions and rallies</li>
        <li>Raise awareness on social media</li>
        <li>Always be educated on mental health issues in your community</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>checking in with loved ones</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Check in on your friends and family -- you never know what someone else is going through</li>
        <li>Ensure your close ones that you are there to listen and support them</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>volunteering or creating your own passion project</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Reach out to local mental health organizations to find volunteering opportunities</li>
        <li>Raise awareness on a mental health cause that you find important</li>
        <li>Bring a chapter of a mental health organization to your local region</li>
      </ul>
