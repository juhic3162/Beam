      <h2>health equity</h2>
      <h4>[helθ , ek.wɪ.ti] , noun </h4>
      <h6>the idea that every individual has equal access to the resources and opportunities needed for a healthy life</h6>
      <p>Imagine a colorful, blooming garden, filled with a variety of plants. Each plant requires specific care, tailored to their needs — some may need more water, whereas others may need more sunlight. In the same way that these plants each have their own special care, humans require health support and resources in a way tailored to their unique circumstances and needs.</p>
      <p>In such a diverse world, we cannot simply use a “one size fits all” approach. Rather than health equality, which is the practice of giving everyone the same resources regardless of their background, it is important to recognize social justice within the health field, as different circumstances require different support. Regardless of zip code, race, gender, and other social factors, everyone deserves fair access to mental health resources. By understanding these diverse needs as a community, we can create a more equitable and supportive health care system for all.</p>

      <h3><i>Why is it important?</i></h3>
      <p>Everyone deserves the opportunity to be as healthy as possible. As a result of the existing inequity in the mental health department and lack of proper mental health support, this opportunity has been deprived of many. Addressing these inequities is vital in order to improve the mental health and well being of our community, especially with the conditions in our modern day world.</p>
      <p>Now more than ever, the rates of mental health disorders are growing rapidly. Especially with the recent pandemic, anxiety and depression rates had gone up 25% worldwide during 2020, according to the World Health Organization. SInce then, in 2024, the National Institutes of Health report that 57.8 million adults suffer from some form of mental illness. And these numbers only continue to rise as mental health inequity continues to remain an issue. </p>
      <p>Due to a multitude of factors, including financial reasons, internal or external stigma, fear, and other social factors, the health equity of our community is at high risk. It is crucial to take action and ensure that individuals receive the help they need, unique to their specific circumstances.</p>

      <h3><i>But why mental health?</i></h3>
      <p>There cannot be health equity without mental health equity. The issues caused by mental health disorders and illnesses impacts more than just the brain, rather it impacts our systemic health, as mental health and physical health are linked. Depending on the severity of the mental illness, negative mental health could lead to sleep problems, smoking, lack of motivation, and possibly even chronic diseases. Mental health deserves to be prioritized in the health field, and even more specifically within health equity.</p>
      <p>From an economic standpoint, the impact of mental health going unnoticed is immense. Stated in a research study posted by the Deloitte Health Equity Institute, The projected costs and economic impact of mental health inequities in the United States, “The great cost of health care (due to chronic physical health conditions) will rise until we tackle the mental health that exacerbate these issues.” By 2040, according to the Deloitte Health Equity Institute, the costs of mental health inequities could potentially rack up to 14 trillion, if these inequities are continuously left unnoticed.</p>

      <h3><i>How does it affect us?</i></h3>
      <p>To some extent, mental health affects each and every one of us. At each phase in our lives, we experience ups and downs, at which point we may feel a certain way
      We experience seeing our closest loved ones go through these same phases. It's important that each one of us understand mental health so we can provide the necessary support for those close to us.
</p>
      <p>Mental health equity starts with us. By creating a supportive environment for our loved ones, we can work towards a supportive community free from mental health stigma, so our community can receive the mental health support they deserve.</p>
